# Winx Manager

Winx Manager is a Windows tool manager designed to simplify access to your folders, automate certain actions, and offer a small, customizable command-line interface.

The goal is to centralize your quick tasks in a single, lightweight, and flexible tool.

## 🎯 Concept

Winx Manager works like a mini, customized CLI.

It brings together in one place everything you use regularly: opening paths, performing system actions, managing your environment, and automating repetitive tasks.

The principle is simple:

- You launch `winx.exe`
- You type your instructions
- Winx takes care of the rest

No complex commands, no cumbersome configuration.

## ✨ Features

### 📂 Folder Management
Winx can open various directories (system, projects, documents, user folders).
Even if the program changes directories internally, it still opens correctly thanks to reliable handling of the current path.

### ⚙️ Lightweight Automation
Some Windows tasks can be launched directly from the CLI without having to navigate between multiple windows.

### 🧩 Extensible Architecture
Winx is built to easily accommodate new tools or shortcuts.

The code is intentionally minimalist to encourage modification and experimentation.

### 🚀 Instant Use
No complex installation.

Download → Run → Use.
